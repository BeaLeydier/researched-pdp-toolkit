		username where it says "INSERT-MACHINE-USERNAME" and enter the file 
		path of your local toolkit folder where it says "INSERT MACHINE SPECIFIC
		FILEPATH". 
		
		If you do not know what is your machine username, you can run the 
		following command into Stata:
			dis "`c(username)'"
			
		What is displayed in response is your machine username. To see all the
		other computer and system parameters stored by Stata, you can run
			creturn list 
			
		For more details on how the following chunk of code works (in particular
		the if conditions and the global), see the extensive comment in the
		dofile 0.Set-Up.do.
