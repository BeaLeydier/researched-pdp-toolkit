/*******************************************************************************

		CREATE TEMPLATE TO LABEL PATHWAY DATA		
				
			This dofile takes you through the steps to labeling your student
			pathway data in a way that will make it convenient to display.
				
*******************************************************************************/

/* 
	This dofile creates a pre-filled template of student pathways for 
	you to define labels for, and saves it under 2_data-toolkit. 
	
	The template consists of the list of pathways included either in your PDP 
	AR files (under the Program of Study variable) or in the student pathway 
	information you have filled out in the previous step. 
	
	For each unique pathway present in your data, it exports the ProgramofStudy
	number. It also creates a unique ID for each pathway in a numeric sequence
	starting from 1, which will make it easier to display pathways side by 
	side in graphs.
	
	For each pathway, you should fill in the ProgramofStudy_Label column with 
	the name of the pathway you want displayed on your graphs.

* Add in Student Pathways entered from the Excel template

*	==========================================
*	PART 4. - Combine Lists of Pathways
*	==========================================

* Load pathway lists
use `pdppathways', clear
capture append using `userpathways'

* Drop duplicates
duplicates drop

* Drop missing values 
drop if program == .

* Add ordered unique identifier for pathway
rename program ProgramofStudy
sort ProgramofStudy
gen ProgramofStudy_ID = _n

* Add label column to fill out
gen ProgramofStudy_Label = ""


*	==========================================
*	PART 3. - Export Data to Fill out
*	==========================================

* Reorder columns 
order ProgramofStudy_ID ProgramofStudy ProgramofStudy_Label, first
