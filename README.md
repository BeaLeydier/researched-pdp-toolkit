# PDP Toolkit Guidance

This README.md document explains how this toolkit is structured, and provides step by step instructions on how to use it with your PDP data. The [ReportDemo.md](https://github.com/BeaLeydier/researched-pdp-toolkit/blob/main/ReportDemo.md) document serves as an example of what kind of report and analyses you can hope to generate with this toolkit.

## Objective: What is this toolkit about?

The goal of this toolkit is to replicate the [CTE Toolkit](https://github.com/rachworsham/open_sdp_cte_toolkit) of the [OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io/) project, using your institution's PDP [Analysis-Ready Files](https://help.studentclearinghouse.org/pdp/knowledge-base/using-the-analysis-ready-files/). It uses Stata to transform and analyze the data, and generates tables and figures for your analysis.

This toolkit contains code and instructions to
- transform your PDP Analysis-Ready Files into the appropriate data structure for our analysis purpose; we will call this step "Make Data"
- use these transformed datasets to create relevant graphs and tables featured in the [CTE Toolkit](https://github.com/rachworsham/open_sdp_cte_toolkit); we will call this step "Make Report"

Given the PDP Analysis-Ready Files follow a standardized, predictable format, the code is meant to be as close to plug-and-play as possible. This readme provides instructions on how to set up the toolkit with your own data and parameters, and where to adjust the code if needed.

Because the PDP Analyis-Ready Files at this time unfortunately do not contain information about students pathways, which is a core dimension of the CTE toolkit analyses, this toolkit also includes a data entry step, aimed at merging student pathway information with information from your PDP Analysis-Ready Files; we will call this step "Enter Data". This readme provide instructions on how to enter and label your student pathway data before running the analyses.

## Contents: What kind of analyses and insights can I expect from this toolkit?

This repository contains an example of the graphs and tables generated by this toolkit in the [ReportDemo.md](https://github.com/BeaLeydier/researched-pdp-toolkit/blob/main/ReportDemo.md). The sections of the report mirror those of the CTE toolkit. It also adds a few dimensions for the analysis, leveraging the specificity and richness of the data present in the PDP Analysis-Ready Files.

Specifically, the sections are

## Getting Started: How do I get the toolkit?

If you are familiar with github, you can fork this repository, and clone it to your local machine.

If you are not familiar with github, you can simply download this repository, and save it anywhere convenient on your local machine. For that, click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Then, navigate to the working directory on your local machine where you want this toolkit to be, and save the repository there. It will be saved as a .zip folder, which is a compressed folder containing all the files and subfolders of this repository. You will need to [unzip](https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File) it.

Whether you fork/clone or download the repository, it is important to keep the folder and subfolder structure intact, as well as keep the existing files and folder names as they are. The code of the toolkit is written with those in mind, and modifying them will require more customization of the existing code before you can run it. While we strongly advise against deleting or renaming existing folders or files, you are more than welcome to add new files to the existing repository as you start working on it.

## Set Up: Where to Start?

Once you have downloaded or cloned the repository to your local machine, you need to define some important Stata-specific parameters. This step only needs to be done once. 

### Add your machine-specific file path

+ instructions on file path at the top of each dofile

### Define custom colors (optional)

+ instructions on where to find + how to change the custom color palette

### Install necessary user-written commands

## Define Parameters : How to run this toolkit with my institution's Analysis-Ready Files?

(step done only once)

- Add AR files in proper folder (mention gitignore)
- Define file name
- Define institution type

## Enter Data : How to add my student's pathway data?

(step done only once)

- Create students pathway template
- Fill the template (link to codebook)
- Create the pathway labeling template
- Fill the template (link to codebook)
- Add names in the Define parameters dofile

### Pathway Data Diagnostics

## Make Data : How do I transform my PDP Analysis-Ready Files into this toolkit's analysis-ready files?

- one script per section
- need to be run in order
- creates one dataframe per report section, following the datafame requirements outlined in the CTE technical guide

## Make Report : How do I create graphs and tables? 

- Data analysis code contents
- How to generate markdown doc
