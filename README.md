# PDP Toolkit Guidance

This readme document serves as both documentation and a mock example of a report you can generate with this toolkit. 

## Objective

Reproduce the CTE toolkit with PDP data
- Detailed instructions and reproducible code to transform the PDP AR files into the datasets specified for the CTE analysis (with the required variables + level of analysis)
- Suggestions of additional analyses and dimensions based on PDP specific data

Caveat : pathway data not in PDP, but this toolkit contains a template to enter + label student pathway data. 

## Overview

- Set Up  : user written commands + ado (custom colors) under 0_scripts
+ instructions on where to find + how to change the custom color palette
